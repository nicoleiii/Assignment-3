I started doing the HTML parts for the Login and the Quiz page. After I finished the HTML, I moved on to the CSS part and styled my quiz. Afterwards, I did JS.

The challenges I faced during this was adding JavaScript. I found it difficult but I managed to do it by looking at examples online to help me figure out what I need to do. I eventually did a bunch of trial and error until I figured it out. I tried my best.
